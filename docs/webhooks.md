# LiquiFact Webhooks

LiquiFact backend emits webhooks to notify tenant systems about important escrow events.

## Event Types

Currently, the following events are supported:
- `escrow_funded`: Emitted when an escrow account reaches its required funding balance.
- `escrow_settled`: Emitted when an escrow transaction is finalized and settled on the Stellar network.

## Security & Signatures

All webhooks include an `X-Signature` header to verify authenticity and integrity. LiquiFact uses HMAC-SHA256 to generate the signature over the deterministic JSON payload string.

### Idempotency
Webhook delivery is at-least-once. Your receiving endpoint should gracefully handle duplicate webhook events by verifying the `invoiceId` or a database record state.

### Verifying Signatures

The signature is constructed using a timestamp to prevent replay attacks. The header looks like:
`t=<timestamp>,v1=<signature>`

**Steps to Verify**:
1. Split the `X-Signature` header by `,` to extract `t` (timestamp) and `v1` (signature).
2. Read the raw HTTP request body as a string. **Do not serialize an already parsed JSON object**, as serialization key orders or whitespace might differ from the exact bytes sent by LiquiFact.
3. Prevent replay attacks: compare the timestamp `t` to your current time and reject events outside of your tolerance window (e.g., 5 minutes).
4. Compute the expected signature:
   `expected_signature = HMAC_SHA256(secret, t + "." + raw_body)`
5. Use a constant-time comparison to check if your expected signature matches the `v1` signature.

### Secret Management
Webhook secrets are configured per tenant. Store this secret securely. The backend will not emit webhooks if the secret is not configured or is empty.

### Code Example (Node.js)

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(secret, rawBody, signatureHeader) {
  const parts = signatureHeader.split(',');
  const t = parts.find(p => p.startsWith('t=')).slice(2);
  const v1 = parts.find(p => p.startsWith('v1=')).slice(3);

  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(`${t}.${rawBody}`)
    .digest('hex');

  const isValid = crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature, 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(v1, 'hex')
  );

  return isValid;
}
```
