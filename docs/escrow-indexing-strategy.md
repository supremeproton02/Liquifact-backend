# Escrow Event Ingest Strategy (Issue #102)

## Goal
Persist a durable, replayable feed of latest Liquifact escrow contract events by `invoiceId`.

## Selected Approach
Use a Horizon-driven poller with cursor checkpointing and projection tables.

- Source: Horizon events API (cursor + ascending order)
- Cursor durability: `escrow_indexer_state`
- Raw immutable event log: `escrow_events`
- Latest per-invoice projection: `escrow_event_projection`

## Projection Ordering Rules
When multiple Horizon events arrive out of order for the same `invoiceId`, the projection is updated only when the incoming event is strictly newer:

- Higher `ledgerSequence` always replaces lower.
- When `ledgerSequence` is equal, `pagingToken` is used as a deterministic tiebreaker; greater `pagingToken` replaces lower.
- Older events are still persisted to the immutable `escrow_events` log but do not overwrite the per-invoice projection.

## Why This Over Captive Core
- Lower operational overhead for current Express service footprint.
- Faster delivery for production-ready MVP.
- Can be upgraded later to Captive Core without schema changes.

## Security Notes
- Indexer is read-only and does not require Stellar secret keys.
- Input validation enforces `invoiceId` format and required event fields.
- Duplicate event IDs are safely ignored by primary-key conflict handling.
- No signing keys or secrets are logged.

## Failure and Recovery
- Cursor is updated only after batch processing.
- On restart, indexer resumes from persisted cursor.
- Invalid events are skipped with warning logs to avoid deadlocking ingestion.
- Cursor is saved only when it changes to keep writes idempotent across repeated cycles.

## Upgrade Path
When throughput or deterministic replay needs exceed Horizon polling limits:
1. Deploy Captive Core feeder.
2. Keep writing to `escrow_events` and `escrow_event_projection`.
3. Reuse existing projection semantics and API readers.
